Build instructions
------------------

The user documentation is [texdimens/README.md](texdimens/README.md) in the
`texdimens/` sub-directory.  It becomes `texdimens.md` in the CTAN releases.
To convert it into a pdf, `cd texdimens` and `make texdimens.pdf` (on
unix-like systems; `pandoc` is a dependency).

To build the `texdimens.zip` archive as used for CTAN uploads, `cd texdimens`
and `make ctan`.  The file will be in the `CTAN/` sub-directory.
