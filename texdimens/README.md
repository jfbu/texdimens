## Usage

Utilities and documentation related to TeX dimensional units, usable:

- with Plain TeX: `\input texdimens`

- with LaTeX: `\usepackage{texdimens}`

## Aim of this package

The aim of this package is to address the issue of expressing dimensions
(or dimension expressions evaluated by `\dimexpr`) in the various TeX
units, to the extent possible.

This project requires the e-TeX extensions `\dimexpr` and `\numexpr`.
The notation `<dim. expr.>` in the macro descriptions refers to a
*dimensional expression* as accepted by `\dimexpr`.  The syntax has some
peculiarities: among them the fact that `-(...)` (for example `-(3pt)`)
is illegal, one must use alternatives such as `0pt-(...)` or a
sub-expression `-\dimexpr...\relax` for example.

Notice that this is WIP and inaccuracies may exist even relative to
descriptions of TeX handlings due to limited time available for the
project.

## Quick review of basics: TeX points and scaled points

TeX dimensions are represented internally by a signed integer which is
in absolute value at most `0x3FFFFFFF`, i.e. `1073741823`.  The
corresponding unit is called the "scaled point", i.e. `1sp` is `1/65536`
of one TeX point `1pt`, or rather `1pt` is represented internally as `65536`.

If `\foo` is a dimen register:

- `\number\foo` produces the integer `N` such as `\foo` is the same as `Nsp`,

- inside `\numexpr`, `\foo` is replaced by `N`,

- `\the\foo` produces a decimal `D` (with at most five places) followed
  with `pt` (catcode 12 tokens) and this output `Dpt` can serve as input
  in a dimen assignment to produce the same dimension as `\foo`.  One can
  also use the catcode 11 characters `pt` for this.  Digits and decimal
  mark must have their standard catcode 12.

When TeX encounters a dimen denotation of the type `Dpt` it will
compute `N` in a way equivalent to `N = round(65536 D)` where ties are
rounded away from zero.  Only 17 decimal places of `D` are
kept as it can be shown that going beyond can not change the result.

When `\foo` has been assigned as `Dpt`, `\the\foo` will produce some
`Ept` where `E` is not necessarily the same as `D`.  But it is guaranteed
that `Ept` defines the same dimension as `Dpt`.

## Further units known to TeX on input

TeX understands on input further units: `bp`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`, `pc`,
`cc`, `nc`, `dd` and `nd`.  It also understands font-dependent units
`ex` and `em`, and PDFTeX adds the `px` dimension unit.  Japanese
engines also add specific units.

The `ex`, `em`, and `px` units are handled somewhat differently by
(pdf)TeX than `bp`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`, `pc`, `cc`, `nc`, `dd` and `nd`
units. For the former (let's use the generic notation `uu`), the exact
same dimensions are obtained from an input `D uu` where `D` is some
decimal or from `D <dimen>` where `<dimen>` stands for some dimension
register which records `1uu` or `\dimexpr1uu\relax`. In contrast, among
the latter, i.e. the core TeX units, this is false except for the `pc`
unit.

TeX associates (explicitly for the core units, implicitly for the units
corresponding to internal dimensions) to each unit `uu` a fraction `phi`
which is a conversion factor.  For the internal dimensions `ex`, `em`,
`px` or in the case of multiplying a dimension by a decimal, this `phi`
is morally `f/65536` where `f` is the integer such that `1 uu=f sp`.
For core units however, the hard-coded ratio `n/d` never has a
denominator `d` whici is a power of `2`, except for the `pc` whose
associated ratio factor is `12/1` (and arguably for the `sp` for which
morally `phi` is `1/65536` but we keep it separate from the general
discussion).

Here is a table with the hard-coded conversion factors:

                             (Python output)     [65536phi]

The values of `1uu` in the `sp` and `pt` units are irrelevant and even
misleading regarding the TeX parsing of `D uu` input.  Notice for
example that `\the\dimexpr1bp\relax` gives `1.00374pt` but the actual
conversion factor is `1.00375`.

When TeX parses an assignment `U uu` with a decimal `U` and a unit `uu`,
be it a core unit, or a unit corresponding to an internal dimension,
it first handles `U` as with the `pt` unit.
This means that it computes `N = round(65536*U)`. It then multiplies
this `N` by the conversion factor `phi` and truncates towards zero the
mathematically exact result to obtain an integer `T`:
`T=trunc(N*phi)`. The assignment `Uuu` is concluded by defining the
value of the dimension to be `Tsp`.

Regarding the core units, we always have `phi>1`.
The increasing
sequence `0<=trunc(phi)<=trunc(2phi)<=...` is thus *strictly increasing*
and, as `phi` is never astronomically close to `1`, 
**it always has jumps**: not all TeX dimensions can be obtained from an
assignment using a core unit distinct from the `pt` (and `sp` of course,
but we already said it was kept out of the discussion here).

On the other hand when `phi<1`, then the sequence `trunc(N phi)` is not
strictly increasing, already because `trunc(phi)=0` and besides here
`phi=f/65536`, so the `65536` integers `0..65535` are mapped to `f`
integers `0..(f-1)` inducing non one-to-oneness. But
all integers in the `0..(2**30-1)` range will be attained for some input,
so there is surjectivity.

The "worst" unit is the largest i.e. the `in` whose conversion factor is
`72.27`.  The simplest unit to understand is the `pc` as it corresponds
to an integer ratio `12`: only dimensions which in scaled points are
multiple of `12` are exactly representable in the `pc` unit.

This also means that some dimensions expressible in one unit may not be
available with another unit.  For example, and perhaps surprisingly,
there is no decimal `D` which would achieve `1in==Dcm`: the "step"
between attainable dimensions is `72--73sp` for the `in` and `28--29sp`
for the `cm`, and as `1in` differs internally from `2.54cm` by only
`12sp` it is impossible to adjust
either the `in` side or the `cm` side to obtain equality.

In particular `1in==2.54cm` is **false** in TeX, but it is true that
`100in==254cm`... (it is already true that `50in==127cm`).  It is also
false that `10in==25.4cm` but it is true that `10in==254mm`... It is
false though that `1in==25.4mm`!

`\maxdimen` can be expressed only with `pt`, `bp`, and `nd`.  For the
other core units the maximal attainable dimensions in `sp` unit are given in
the middle column of the next table.

Perhaps for these various peculiarities with dimensional units, TeX does
not provide an output facility for them similar to what `\the` achieves for
the `pt`.

## Macros of this package (summary)

This package provides expandable (most are f-expandable, see the code)
macros (they can be nested as they parse their inputs via `\dimexpr`):

- `\texdimenpt`,
- `\texdimenUU`, `\texdimenUUup` and
  `\texdimenUUdown` with `UU` standing for one of `bp`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`,
  `pc`, `cc`, `nc`, `dd` and `nd`,
- `\texdimenbothincm` (and relatives not listed here, see below),
- and `\texdimenwithunit`, added at `0.99`.

For example `\texdimenbp` takes on input some dimension or dimension
expression and produces on output a decimal `D` such that `D bp` is
guaranteed to be the same dimension as the input, if that one admits any
representation as `E bp`; else it will be either the closest match from
above or from below. The `\texdimenbpup` and `\texdimenbpdown` allow to
choose the direction of approximation.

`\texdimenwithunit{<dimen1>}{<dimen2>}` produces a decimal `D` such
that `D \dimexpr dimen2\relax` is represented internally the same as
`dimen1` if at all possible, else is a closest match, but one does not
know if from below or above. If `dimen2<1pt` all TeX dimensions `dimen1`
are attainable. If `dimen2>1pt` not all `dimen1` are attainable.

Negative dimensions behave as if replaced by their absolute value, then
at last step the sign (if result is not zero) is applied (so "down" means
"towards zero", and "up" means "away from zero").

Do not confuse `\texdimenwithunit{dim}{1bp}` with
`\texdimenbp{dim}`. The former produces a decimal `D` such that
`D\dimexpr 1bp\relax` is represented internally as is `dim` if at all
possible, whereas the latter produces a decimal `D` such that `D bp` is
the one aiming at being the same as `dim`. Using `D\dimexpr 1bp\relax`
implies a conversion factor equal to `65781/65536`, whereas `D bp`
involves the `803/800` conversion factor.


## Macros of this package (full list)

1. For input `X` equal to (or sufficiently close to) `\maxdimen` and
   those units `uu` for which `\maxdimen` is not exactly representable
   (i.e. all core units except `pt`, `bp` and `nd`), the output `D` of the
   "up" macros `\texdimen<uu>up{X}`, if used as `Duu` in a dimension
   assignment or expression, will (naturally) trigger a "Dimension too
   large" error.
2. For `dd`, `nc` and `in`, and input `X` equal to (or sufficiently
   close to) `\maxdimen` it turns out that `\texdimen<uu>{X}` produces
   an output `D` such that `Duu` is the first "virtually attainable" TeX
   dimension *beyond* `\maxdimen`.  Hence `Duu` will trigger on use
   "Dimension too large error".
3. Again for the `dd`, `nc` and `in` units, both the "down" and "up" macros
   will trigger "Dimension too large" during their execution if used
   with an input equal to (or sufficiently close to) `\maxdimen`.
4. With `\texdimenwithunit{dimen1}{dimen2}` and if `\maxdimen`
   is not representable exactly by `dimen2` used as a base dimension,
   (which may happen only if `dimen2>1pt`) it might
   be that the decimal `D` produced from `\maxdimen` or nearby dimensions
   will trigger "Dimension too large" if an attempt to use `D <dimen2>` is
   made.

## Extras?

As already stated the "up" and also the "down" macros for the `dd`, `nc`
and `in` units will trigger "Dimension too large" if used with inputs
equal to or very near `\maxdimen`.  "Safe" variants which are guaranteed
never to trigger this error but have some extra overhead to filter out
inputs very close to `\maxdimen` will *perhaps* be provided if there is
some demand for it.

But of course anyhow the output from the "up" macros if used
as input with the corresponding unit will be beyond `\maxdimen` if the
latter is not attainable, i.e. for all units except `bp`, and `nd`
(and `pt` but there is no "up" macro for it).

The
dimensions representable with both `in` and `cm` units have the shape
`trunc(3613.5*k)sp` for some integer `k`. The largest one smaller
than a given dimension will thus differ from it by at most about `0.055pt`,
which is also about `0.02mm`.

For example `\texdimenbothincm{1cm}` expands to `0.99994cm` which maps
internally to `1864566sp` which differs from TeX's `1cm` by only
`-113sp`. It can be obtained from `0.39368in` or `28.45102pt`.

And `\texdimenbothcmin{1in}` expands to `0.99945in`, maps internally to
`4733685sp` which differs from TeX's `1in` by `-2601sp`. It can be obtained
as `2.5386cm` or `72.2303pt`.

Currently the package does not provide analogous approximations from above.
For the `1in` for example it would be `4737298sp`, i.e. `1.00021in` which
differs from TeX's `1in` by `+1012sp` and is obtained also as `2.54054cm`
and `72.28543pt`.

Thanks to Denis Bitouz√© for raising an
[issue](https://github.com/latex3/latex3/issues/953)
on the LaTeX3 tracker which became the initial stimulus for this package.

Thanks to Ruixi Zhang for reviving the above linked-to thread
and opening up here [issue #2](https://github.com/jfbu/texdimens/issues/2)
asking to add handling of the `ex`,`em`, and `px` cases. This was done
at release `0.99` via the addition of `\texdimenwithunit`.
