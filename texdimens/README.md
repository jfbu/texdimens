## Usage

Utilities and documentation related to TeX dimensional units, usable:

- with Plain TeX: `\input texdimens`

- with LaTeX: `\usepackage{texdimens}`

## Aim of this package

The aim of this package is to provide facilities to express dimensions
(or dimension expressions evaluated by `\dimexpr`) using the various
available TeX units, to the extent possible.

## Macros of this package (summary)

This package provides expandable macros:

- `\texdimenUU` with `UU` standing for one of `pt`, `bp`, `cm`, `mm`,
  `in`, `pc`, `cc`, `nc`, `dd` and `nd`,
- `\texdimenUUup` and `\texdimenUUdown` with `UU` as above except `pt`,
- `\texdimenbothincm` and relatives,
- `\texdimenbothbpmm` and relatives,
- `\texdimenwithunit`.

`\texdimenbp` takes on input some dimension or dimension expression and
produces on output a decimal `D` such that `D bp` is guaranteed to be
the same dimension as the input, *if* it admits any representation as `E
bp`; else it will be either the closest match from above or from
below. For this unit, as well as for `nd` and `dd` the difference is at
most `1sp`. For other units (not `pt` of course) the distance will
usually be larger than `1sp` and one does not know if the approximant
from the other direction would have been better or worst.

The variants `\texdimenbpup` and `\texdimenbpdown` expand slightly less
fast than `\texdimenbp` but they allow to choose the direction of
approximation (in absolute value). The macros for the other units have
the same descriptions.

`\texdimenbothincm`, respectively `\texdimenbothbpmm`, find the largest
(in absolute value) dimension not exceeding the input and exactly
representable both with the `in` and `cm` units, respectively exactly
representable both with the `bp` and `mm` units.

`\texdimenwithunit{<dimen1>}{<dimen2>}` produces a decimal `D` such that
`D \dimexpr dimen2\relax` is parsed by TeX into the same dimension as
`dimen1` if this is at all possible.  If `dimen2<1pt` all TeX dimensions
`dimen1` are attainable.  If `dimen2>1pt` not all `dimen1` are
attainable.  If not attainable, the decimal `D` will ensure a closest
match from below or from above but one does not know if the
approximation from the other direction is better or worst.

In a sense, this macro divides `<dimen1>` by `<dimen2>`, see additional
details in the complete macro description.

## Quick review of basics: TeX points and scaled points

This project requires the e-TeX extensions `\dimexpr` and `\numexpr`.
The notation `<dim. expr.>` in the macro descriptions refers to a
*dimensional expression* as accepted by `\dimexpr`.  The syntax has some
peculiarities: among them the fact that `-(...)` (for example `-(3pt)`)
is illegal, one must use alternatives such as `0pt-(...)` or a
sub-expression `-\dimexpr...\relax` for example.

TeX dimensions are represented internally by a signed integer which is
in absolute value at most `0x3FFFFFFF`, i.e. `1073741823`.  The
corresponding unit is called the "scaled point", i.e. `1sp` is `1/65536`
of one TeX point `1pt`, or rather `1pt` is represented internally as `65536`.

If `\foo` is a dimen register:

- `\number\foo` produces the integer `N` such as `\foo` is the same as `Nsp`,

- inside `\numexpr`, `\foo` is replaced by `N`,

- `\the\foo` produces a decimal `D` (with at most five places) followed
  with `pt` (catcode 12 tokens) and this output `Dpt` can serve as input
  in a dimen assignment to produce the same dimension as `\foo`.  One can
  also use the catcode 11 characters `pt` for this.  Digits and decimal
  mark must have their standard catcode 12.

When TeX encounters a dimen denotation of the type `Dpt` it will
compute `N` in a way equivalent to `N = round(65536 D)` where ties are
rounded away from zero.  Only 17 decimal places of `D` are
kept as it can be shown that going beyond can not change the result.

When `\foo` has been assigned as `Dpt`, `\the\foo` will produce some
`Ept` where `E` is not necessarily the same as `D`.  But it is guaranteed
that `Ept` defines the same dimension as `Dpt`.

## Further units known to TeX on input

TeX understands on input further units: `bp`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`, `pc`,
`cc`, `nc`, `dd` and `nd`.  It also understands font-dependent units
`ex` and `em`, and PDFTeX adds the `px` dimension unit.  Japanese
engines also add specific units.

The `ex`, `em`, and `px` units are handled somewhat differently by
(pdf)TeX than `bp`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`, `pc`, `cc`, `nc`, `dd` and `nd`
units. For the former (let's use the generic notation `uu`), the exact
same dimensions are obtained from an input `D uu` where `D` is some
decimal or from `D <dimen>` where `<dimen>` stands for some dimension
register which records `1uu` or `\dimexpr1uu\relax`. In contrast, among
the latter, i.e. the core TeX units, this is false except for the `pc`
unit.

TeX associates (explicitly for the core units, implicitly for the units
corresponding to internal dimensions) to each unit `uu` a fraction `phi`
which is a conversion factor.  For the internal dimensions `ex`, `em`,
`px` or in the case of multiplying a dimension by a decimal, this `phi`
is morally `f/65536` where `f` is the integer such that `1 uu=f sp`.
For core units however, the hard-coded ratio `n/d` never has a
denominator `d` which is a power of `2`, except for the `pc` whose
associated ratio factor is `12/1` (and arguably for the `sp` for which
morally `phi` is `1/65536` but we keep it separate from the general
discussion; as well as `pt` with its unit conversion factor).

Here is a table with the hard-coded conversion factors:

The values of `1uu` in the `sp` and `pt` units are irrelevant and even
misleading regarding the TeX parsing of `D uu` input.  Notice for
example that `\the\dimexpr1bp\relax` gives `1.00374pt` but the actual
conversion factor is `1.00375` (and
`1.00375pt=65782sp>1bp`...). Similarly `\the\dimexpr1in\relax` outputs
`72.26999pt` and is represented internally as `4736286sp` but the actual
conversion factor is `72.27=7227/100`, and
`72.27pt=4736287sp>1in`... And for the other units except the `pc`, the
conversion factors are not decimal numbers, so even less likely to match
`\the<1uu>` as listed in the last column. Their denominators are not
powers of `2` so they don't match exactly either `(1uu in sp)/65536` but
are only close.

When TeX parses an assignment `U uu` with a decimal `U` and a unit `uu`,
be it a core unit, or a unit corresponding to an internal dimension,
it first handles `U` as with the `pt` unit.
This means that it computes `N = round(65536*U)`. It then multiplies
this `N` by the conversion factor `phi` and truncates towards zero the
mathematically exact result to obtain an integer `T`:
`T=trunc(N*phi)`. The assignment `Uuu` is concluded by defining the
value of the dimension to be `Tsp`.

Regarding the core units, we always have `phi>1`.
The increasing
sequence `0<=trunc(phi)<=trunc(2phi)<=...` is thus *strictly increasing*
and, as `phi` is never astronomically close to `1`, 
**it always has jumps**: not all TeX dimensions can be obtained from an
assignment using a core unit distinct from the `pt` (and `sp` of course,
but we already said it was kept out of the discussion here).

On the other hand when `phi<1`, then the sequence `trunc(N phi)` is not
strictly increasing, already because `trunc(phi)=0` and besides here
`phi=f/65536`, so the `65536` integers `0..65535` are mapped to `f`
integers `0..(f-1)` inducing non one-to-oneness. But
all integers in the `0..(2**30-1)` range will be attained for some input,
so there is surjectivity.

The "worst" unit is the largest i.e. the `in` whose conversion factor is
`72.27`.  The simplest unit to understand is the `pc` as it corresponds
to an integer ratio `12`: only dimensions which in scaled points are
multiple of `12` are exactly representable in the `pc` unit.

This also means that some dimensions expressible in one unit may not be
available with another unit.  For example, and perhaps surprisingly,
there is no decimal `D` which would achieve `1in==Dcm`: the "step"
between attainable dimensions is `72--73sp` for the `in` and `28--29sp`
for the `cm`, and as `1in` differs internally from `2.54cm` by only
`12sp` it is impossible to adjust
either the `in` side or the `cm` side to obtain equality.

In particular `1in==2.54cm` is **false** in TeX, but it is true that
`100in==254cm`... (it is already true that `50in==127cm`).  It is also
false that `10in==25.4cm` but it is true that `10in==254mm`... It is
false though that `1in==25.4mm`!

`\maxdimen` can be expressed only with `pt`, `bp`, and `nd`.  For the
other core units the maximal attainable dimensions in `sp` unit are given in
the middle column of the next table.

Perhaps for these various peculiarities with dimensional units, TeX does
not provide an output facility for them similar to what `\the` achieves for
the `pt`.

## Macros of this package (full list)

The macros are all expandable, and most are f-expandable (check the
source code). They parse their arguments via `\dimexpr` so can be nested
(with appropriate units added, as the outputs always are bare decimal
numbers).

Negative dimensions behave as if replaced by their absolute value, then
at last step the sign (if result is not zero) is applied (so "down" means
"towards zero", and "up" means "away from zero").

Remarks about "Dimension too large" issues:

1. For input `X` equal to `\maxdimen` (or differing by a few `sp`'s) and
   those units `uu` for which `\maxdimen` is not exactly representable
   (i.e. all core units except `pt`, `bp` and `nd`), the output `D` of
   the "up" macros `\texdimen<uu>up{X}`, if used as `Duu` in a dimension
   assignment or expression, will (as is logical) trigger a "Dimension
   too large" error.
2. For `dd`, `nc` and `in`, it turns out that `\texdimen<uu>{X}` chooses
   the "up" approximant for `X` equal to or very near `\maxdimen`,
   i.e. the output `D` is such that `Duu` is the first virtually
   attainable dimension beyond `\maxdimen`. Hence `Duu` will trigger on
   use a "Dimension too large error".  With the other units for which
   `\maxdimen` is not attainable exactly, `\texdimen<uu>{\maxdimen}`
   output is by luck the "down" approximant.
2. As is to be similarly expected, the output `D` from
   `\texdimenwithunit{X}{dimen2}`, if used as `D<dimen2>` may trigger
   "Dimension too large" if `\maxdimen` is not representable exactly as
   a decimal multiple of `dimen2` and `X` is sufficiently near
   `\maxdimen`.  This may happen only if `dimen2>1pt`.

## Extras?

As already stated the "up" and also the "down" macros for the `dd`, `nc`
and `in` units will trigger "Dimension too large" if used with inputs
equal to or very near `\maxdimen`.  "Safe" variants which are guaranteed
never to trigger this error but have some extra overhead to filter out
inputs very close to `\maxdimen` will *perhaps* be provided if there is
some demand for it.

But of course anyhow the output from the "up" macros if used
as input with the corresponding unit will be beyond `\maxdimen` if the
latter is not attainable, i.e. for all units except `bp`, and `nd`
(and `pt` but there is no "up" macro for it).

The
dimensions representable with both `in` and `cm` units have the shape
`trunc(3613.5*k)sp` for some integer `k`. The largest one not exceeding
a given dimension will thus differ from it by at most about `0.055pt`,
which is also about `0.02mm`.

For example `\texdimenbothincm{1cm}` expands to `0.99994cm` which maps
internally to `1864566sp` which differs from TeX's `1cm` by only
`-113sp`. It can be obtained from `0.39368in` or `28.45102pt`.

And `\texdimenbothcmin{1in}` expands to `0.99945in`, maps internally to
`4733685sp` which differs from TeX's `1in` by `-2601sp`. It can be obtained
as `2.5386cm` or `72.2303pt`.

Currently the package does not provide analogous approximations from above.
For the `1in` for example it would be `4737298sp`, i.e. `1.00021in` which
differs from TeX's `1in` by `+1012sp` and is obtained also as `2.54054cm`
and `72.28543pt`.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Denis Bitouz√© for raising an
[issue](https://github.com/latex3/latex3/issues/953)
on the LaTeX3 tracker which became the initial stimulus for this package.

Thanks to Ruixi Zhang for reviving the above linked-to thread and
opening up on the package issue tracker the
[issue #2](https://github.com/jfbu/texdimens/issues/2) asking to add
handling of the `ex` and `em` cases. This was done at release `0.99` via
the addition of `\texdimenwithunit`.

Renewed thanks to Ruixi Zhang for analyzing at
[issue #10](https://github.com/jfbu/texdimens/issues/10) what is at
stake into finding dimensions exactly representable both in the `bp` and
`mm` units. Macros `\texdimenbothbpmm` and `\texdimenbothmmbp` now
address this (release `1.0`).
