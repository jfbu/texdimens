% Mathematics ("down" and "up" macros)
% ===========
%
% In the entire discussion here, "uu" stands for some core unit,
% or some unit corresponding to a dimension > 1pt. For the case
% of a unit corresponding to a dimension < 1pt, i.e. to
% \texdimenwithunit macro added at 0.99, refer to the
% comments of issue #2 on the tracker site.
%
% Is T sp attainable from unit "uu"?.
% If not, what is largest dimension < Tsp which is attainable?
% Here we suppose T>0.
%
% phi>1, psi=1/phi, psi<1.
%
%     U(N,phi)=trunc(N phi) is the strictly increasing sequence,
%     indexed by non-negative integers, of attainable dimensions.
%     (in sp unit)
%
%     U(N)<= T <  U(N+1)    iff    N = ceil((T+1)psi) - 1
%     U(M)<  T <= U(M+1)    iff    M = ceil(T psi)    - 1
%
% Stumbling block
% ---------------
%
% The stumbling block is that computing "ceil((T+1)psi) - 1" without
% overflow is not obvious: yes \numexpr/\dimexpr allow so-called
% "scaling operations" but only in the "rounding up" variant.
%
% If we attempt computing the ceil(x) function via round(x+0.5),
% for example with psi=100/7227 which corresponds to the unit "in",
% this necessitates evaluating:
%
%     round((((T+1)*200)+7227)/14454)
%
% But as far as I can tell currently, for this we need to be able
% to evaluate without overflow (T+1)*200+7227 and this limits to
% T's which are (roughly) such that 100 T is less than \maxdimen.
%
% A work-around
% -------------
%
% The rest of the discussion is about an algorithm providing an
% alternative route to N, using \numexpr/\dimexpr/TeX facilities,
% and working with (almost, as we will see) the full range of allowed
% T's, 0 < T <= \maxdimen. (that the algorithm works for T=0 is to be
% checked manually after the main discussion).
%
% Let's return to the U(N)<= T < U(N+1) and U(M)< T <= U(M+1) equations.
%
% Either (recall in all of this T > 0):
%
% case1:  M = N, i.e. T is not attainable, M=N < T psi < (T+1) psi <= N+1
% case2:  M = N - 1, i.e. T is attained, T psi <= N < (T+1) psi, T = trunc(N phi)
%
% Let X = round(T psi). And let Y = trunc(X phi). We will explain later
% how X and Y can be computed using \numexpr/\dimexpr/TeX.
%
% case1: X can be N or N+1. It will be N+1 iff Y > T.
% case2: X can be N or N-1. It will be N iff trunc((X+1)phi)>T.
%
% This is not convenient: if Y < T it could be that we are in case 2
% but to decide we must check if trunc((X+1) phi) = T or not, so
% this means a second computation.
%
% If psi < 0.5
% ------------
%
% The situation then simplifies:
%
% case1: X can be N or N+1. It will be N+1 iff Y = trunc(X phi) > T.
% case2: X is necessarily N.
%
% Thus:
% a) compute X = round(T psi)
% b) compute Y = trunc(X phi) and test if Y > T. If true, we
%    were in case 1, replace X by X - 1, else we were either
%    in case 1 or case 2, and we leave X as it is.
% We have thus found N.
%
% The operation Y = trunc(X phi) can be achieved this way:
% i) use \the\dimexpr to convert X sp into D pt,
% ii) use \the\numexpr\dimexpr  to convert "D uu" into sp.
% These steps give Y.
%
% This way we find the maximal dimension at most T sp exactly
% representable in "uu" unit.
%
% The computations of X and Y can be done independently of sign of T.
% But the final test has to be changed to Y < T if T < 0 and then
% one must replace X by X+1. So we must filter out the sign of the input.
%
% If the goal is only to find a decimal D such that "D uu" is
% exactly T sp in the case this is possible, then things are simpler
% because from X = round(T psi) we get D such as X sp is same as D pt
% and "D uu" will work.
% We don't have to take sign into account for this computation.
% But if T sp was not attainable we don't know if this X will give
% a D such that D uu < T sp or D uu > T sp.
%
% If psi > 0.5
% ------------
%
% For example unit "bp" has phi=803/800.
%
% It is then not true that if T sp is attainable, the X = round(T psi)
% will always work.
%
% But it is true that R = round((T + 0.5) psi) will always work.
% Here we must use -0.5 if T < 0, though.
%
% This R=round((T+0.5) psi) can always be computed via \numexpr because 2T+1
% will not trigger arithmetic overflow.
%
% So this gives an approach to find a D such that "D uu" is exactly
% T sp when this is possible.
%
% If Tsp (positive) is not attainable, this R however can produce
% either N or N+1.
%
% But we can decide what happened by computing Z = trunc(R phi).
% If and only if Z > T this means R was N+1.
%
% It is slightly less costly to compute X = round(T psi) than
% R = round((T + 0.5) psi),
% but if we then realize that trunc(X phi) < T  we do not yet know
% if trunc((X+1) phi) = T  or is > T. So we proceed via R, not X,
% to not have to make a second computation if a dimension comparison
% test goes awry.
%
% To recapitulate: we have our algorithm for all units to find out
% maximal dimension exactly attainable in "uu" unit and at most equal
% to (positive) T sp.
%
% Unfortunately the check that Y (in case psi < 0.5) or Z (in case psi >
% 0.5) verifies or not Y > T may trigger a Dimension too large error if
% T sp was near non-attainable \maxdimen. It turns out this sad
% situation happens only for the units `dd`, `nc`, and `in`, and T sp
% very close to \maxdimen (like for all units apart from `pt`, `bp`,
% `nd`, the \maxdimen is not attainable, and by bad luck for `dd`, `nc`,
% and `in`, the X will correspond to a decimal D such that Duu>\maxdimen
% is the nearest virtually attaible dimensions from above not from
% below; see the README.md for the tabulation of the maximal usable inputs).
%
% Regarding the \texdimen<uu> macros, and units with phi > 2, I
% hesitated using either the round((T+0.5)psi) or round(T psi), but for
% Tsp = \maxdimen, both formulas turned out to give the same result for
% all such units, so I chose for these \texdimen<uu> macros and the
% units with phi>2 to use the simpler round(T psi) which does not need
% to check the sign of T.
%
% For the "up" and "down" macros, we again use the round(T psi), but do
% have to check the sign anyhow. We could also have used the
% round((T+0.5)psi) which requires a sign check too, but it costs a bit
% more. It would have allowed though to share the same codebase for all
% units, here we have to prepare some slightly different shared macros
% for the first batch bp, nd, dd and the second batch mm, pc, nc, cc,
% cm, in.

% Mathematics ("both" macros)
% ===========
%
% Let a and b be two non-negative integers such that U = floor(a 7227/100) = 
% floor(b 7227/254).  It can be proven that a=50k, b=127k for some integer k.
% The proof is left to reader.  So U = floor(7227 k /2) for some k.
%
% Let's now find the largest such U <= T. So U = floor(k 7227/2)<= T which is
% equivalent (as k is integer) to k 7227/2 <= T + 1/2, i.e.
%
%     kmax = floor((2T+1)/7227)
%
% If we used for x>0 the formula floor(x)=round(x-1/2)=<x-1/2> we would end
% up basically with some 4T hence overflow problems even in \numexpr.
% Here I used <.> to denote rounding in the sense of \numexpr. It is not
% 1-periodical due to how negative inputs are handled, but here x-1/2>-1/2.
%
% The following lemma holds: let T be a non-negative integer then
%
%     floor((2T+1)/7227) = <(2T - 3612)/7227>
%
% So we can compute this k, hence get a=50k, b=127k, all within \numexpr and
% avoiding overflow.
%
% Implementation
% ==============
%
% Regarding the output in pt or sp, we seem to need floor(k 7227/2).
% The computation of floor(k 7227/2) as <(7227 k - 1)/2> would require to
% check if k==0 so we do it rather as <(7227 k + 1)/2> - 1.  No overflow
% can arise as k = 297147 for \maxdimen, and then 7227 k = 2**31 - 2279 and
% there is ample room for 7227k+1 using \numexpr.
%
% But this step, as well as initial step to get kmax will require to separate
% handling of negative input from positive one.
%
% Alternative
% -----------
%
% For non-negative T we can compute U = ((T+1)/7227)*7227. If U <= T keep it,
% else if U > T, replace it by U - 3614. This is alternative road to the maximal
% floor(k 7227/2) at most equal to T.

% Mathematics
% ===========
%
% As explained in the README.md, the ex and em units are
% handled by TeX via a conversion factor f/65536 where f sp = 1ex
% resp. 1em. In particular input D em is handled the exact same
% way as D\dimexpr 1em\relax for any decimal D; this was not
% the case for the core units apart pt and sp, as the conversion
% factor n/d for them neither has power of 2 denominator. The other
% difference is that n/d>1 for the core units whereas 1ex may be <1pt.
%
% If f/65536 > 1, the analysis is as above : some dimensions T sp
% are not attainable as D uu, but N=round((2T+1)*32768/f) will give
% a suitable decimal D via \the\dimexpr N sp\relax (here assume T>0),
% such as D uu = T sp if such a thing is at all possible else it
% will be nearest either from above or below (not necessarily
% nearest overall).
%
% If f/65536<1, all dimensions Tsp are attainable as D uu. Indeed
% D uu is parsed by TeX via N=round(D*65536), then T=trunc(N*phi),
% with phi=f/65536. Starting from T we need to find an N such that
% T/phi <= N< (T+1)/phi. We first consider v=(T+0.5)/phi. As its
% distance to the extremities is 0.5/phi>0.5, its rounding M
% to an integer verifies automatically T/phi < M < (T+1)/phi, so
% is a candidate. The TeX core conversion of Msp to a Dpt with
% D a decimal of at most 5 fractional digits will provide a D
% such that indeed M=round(D*65536).
%
% The above was explained for positive T.
%
% Implementation
% ==============
%
% \texdimenwithunit{dim1}{dim2}. dim2>0 assumed.
% We first get f from dim2 and branch according to whether f>=65536 or
% f<65536. We will also need to check the sign of T (dim1=T sp).
% We then compute in both branches round((2T+1)*32768/f), but
% in an indirect way in the f<65536 branch to avoid overflow.
%
% In the f<65536 branch we first do the Euclidean division
% 2T+1 = k*2*f + R with 0<=R<2f. The k is obtained as round((2T+1-f)/(2f))
% which can be computed in a numexpr (and never gives -1 even for T=0)
% Then (2T+1)*32768/f=65536*k + R*32768/f
% Then R*32768/f<=65536-32768/f<65536-32768/65536=65536-0.5
% Hence the numexpr evaluation gives an integer B<65536.
%
% N.B.: if f>=65536, we still have R*32768/f<65536 as R<2f
% so the only difference is that the B could be here 65536
%
% From \the\dimexpr Bsp, we get a decimal E < 1, so E=0.ddddd
% (or less digits) and the looked for D will be the contatenation
% k.ddddd with k as obtained earlier. This procedure has no possible
% arithmetic overflow.
