% Is T sp attainable from unit "uu"?. Here we suppose T>0.
% phi>1, psi=1/phi, psi<1
% U(N,phi)=trunc(N phi) is strictly increasing
%     U(N)<= T <  U(N+1)    iff    N = ceil((T+1)psi) - 1
%     U(M)<  T <= U(M+1)    iff    M = ceil(T psi)    - 1
% Either:
% case1:  M = N, i.e. T is not attainable, M=N < T psi < (T+1) psi <= N+1
% case2:  M = N - 1, i.e. T is attained, T psi <= N < (T+1) psi, T = floor(N phi) 
%
% Let X = round(T psi). And let Y = trunc(X phi).
%
% case1: X can be N or N+1. It will be N+1 iff Y > T.
% case2: X can be N or N-1. It will be N iff trunc((X+1)phi)>T.
%
% This is not convenient: if Y <= T it might still be that we are in case 2
% and we must check then if trunc((X+1) phi) > T or not.
%
% If psi < 0.5
% ------------
%
% The situation then simplifies:
%
% case1: X can be N or N+1. It will be N+1 iff Y = trunc(X phi) > T.
% case2: X is necessarily N.
%
% Thus:
% a) compute X = round(T psi)
% b) compute Y = trunc(X phi) and test if Y > T. If true, we
%    were in case 1, replace X by X - 1, else we were either
%    in case 1 or case 2, but we can leave X as is.
% We have thus found N.
%
% The operation Y = trunc(X phi) can be achieved this way:
% i) use \the\dimexpr to convert X sp into D pt, 
% ii) use \the\numexpr\dimexpr  to convert "D uu" into sp.
% These steps give Y.
%
% This way we find the maximal dimension at most T sp exactly
% representable in "uu" unit.
%
% The computations of X and Y can be done independently of sign of T.
% But the final test has to be changed to Y < T if T < 0 and then
% one must replace X by X+1. So we must filter sign.
%
% If the goal is only to find a decimal D such that "D uu" is 
% exactly T sp in the case this is possible, then things are simpler
% because from X = round(T psi) we get D such as X sp is same as D pt
% and "D uu" will work.
% We don't have to take sign into account for this computation.
% But if T sp was not atteignable we don't know if this X will give
% a D such that D uu < T sp or D uu > T sp.
%
% If psi > 0.5
% ------------
%
% For example unit "bp" has phi=803/800.
%
% It is then not true that if T sp is atteignable, the X = round(T psi)
% will always work.
%
% But it is true that R = round((T + 0.5) psi) will always work.
% Here we must use -0.5 if T < 0, though.
%
% This R=round((T+0.5) psi) can always be computed via \numexpr because 2T+1
% will not trigger arithmetic overflow.
%
% So this gives an approach to find a D such that "D uu" is exactly
% T sp when this is possible.
% 
% If Tsp (positive) is not attainable, this R however can produce
% either N or N+1.
%
% But we can decide what happened by computing Z = trunc(R phi).
% If and only if Z > T this means R was N+1.
%
% It is slightly less costly to compute X = round(T psi) than
% R = round((T + 0.5) psi),
% but if we then realize that trunc(X phi) < T  we do not yet know
% if trunc((X+1) phi) = T  or is > T.
%
% To recapitulate: we have our algorithm for all units to find out
% maximal dimension exactly atteignable in "uu" unit and at most equal
% to (positive) T sp.
%
% Unfortunately the check that Y (in case psi < 0.5) or Z (in case psi >
% 0.5) may trigger a Dimension too large error if T sp was near
% non-atteignable \maxdimen.
%
% For additional envisioned "safe versions" we would tabulate first per unit
% what is the integer Rmax such that trunc(Rmax phi) <= \maxdimen. Then
% the "safe" versions would have an extra check of X or R before
% proceeding further. But the "up macros" supposed to give the next
% dimension above Tsp and exactly atteignable in "uu" unit, if compliant
% to their description can not avoid "Dimension too large" for inputs
% close to non-attainable \maxdimen.
%
% After having written the macros we will tabulate what is for each unit
% the maximal attainable dimension.
%
% About the macros such as \texdiminbp whose constraints are:
% - give a decimal D such that  "Duu" = "T sp" for TeX if possible
% - else give nearest from below or above without knowing
%   which one,
%
% there was some hesitation about whether or not using the simpler
% round(T psi) approach for units > 2pt and the \texdimin<uu> macros.
% Testing showed that this did not change the output for \maxdimen
% with the units "nc" and "in": still N+1 is returned...
%
% As it has great
% advantage to not have to check the sign of the input, the
% "simpler" approach was chosen for those units to which it
% applies, i.e. the units uu > 2pt (phi>2, psi<1/2), i.e.
% all units except bp, nd and dd.
