% etex '\def\RSEED{<randomseed}\input benchmark_allupdown_random.tex'
% (or the \RSEED will itself be randomly generated)
% Conclusion:
% - the old macros are faster for some inputs
% - but these inputs seem relatively rare
% - and the difference is never much more than 2% or 3%
% - on the other hand, often the new macros are 5%-10%
%   faster, sometimes even 20%-30%
% Also, new output is always exactly like old in all testing done
% (but this is no proof, I had at some point earlier a typo in ncup
%  which was never caught by testing; but since I generated all
%  new macros out of a template)
