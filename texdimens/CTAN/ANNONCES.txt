Release 0.9beta du 30 juin 2021

Téléversé sur CTAN le 30 juin 2021 vers 15h15

Utilities and documentation related to TeX dimensional units,
usable both with Plain (\input texdimens) and with LaTeX
(\usepackage{texdimens}).

This is a beta release which provides the following macros:

- \texdiminbp{<dim. expr.>}: produces a decimal D such that the
  TeX dimension Dbp either matches exactly the input, if this is
  possible, else is either the closest match from above or from
  below (but one does not know which one). For the bp unit this
  means Dbp differs by at most 1sp from input.

- Eight similar macros \texdimin<uu> where <uu> is one of nd,
  dd, mm, pc, nc, cc, cm, or in.

- \texdiminpt{<dim. expr.>} is like LaTeX's \strip@pt

Please refer to README.md for detailed and important usage
information, and to the code comments for the underlying
mathematics.
